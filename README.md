# OS-materials
- A small sampling of the materials I created for the operating systems course that I was a TA for. 

- ****Most of the exercises created cannot be included in this repo as they contain info/tips related to the course assignments (which cannot be shared). Similar situation for the videos and recordings I produced for the course. If you are a current TA for the course, feel free to email me if you'd like the full materials for the course. ****
